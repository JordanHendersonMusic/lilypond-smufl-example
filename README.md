# lilypond-smufl-example

A simple example of how to use Smufl fonts in lilypond. 
See example.ly.

The 3 other files may be placed in a folder on your computer and include from anywhere else. 
However it is easier to put them in a folder and copy that folder anew to each project.

Code taken from https://github.com/lyp-packages/smufl with a few small changes, mostly altering the styles.
